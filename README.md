# TempAndHumController
The project aimed at designing a temperature and humidity controller for a greenhouse using an Arduino.DHT11 sensor was used to compute the value of 
temperature and humidity of the surroundings.The values were then recorded into an excel file using gobetwino software.The data recorded using
the sensor was further used for data analysis.The model was trained by downloading a dataset from kaggle which was for the weather in Delhi
for the previous years.Then the data collected in the excel files were used to test the model.The accuracy can be viewed inside the code.
